10. Destructuring and Template Literals
Objective: Use destructuring and template literals to simplify code.
Instructions:
Create an object employee with properties: firstName, lastName, position.
Destructure the object and log a sentence like: "John Doe works as a Developer."
Use template literals for the string.
SOLUTION:

const employee = {
  firstName : "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  position : "Software Developer"
};

const {firstName , lastName , position} = employee;


console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} works as a ${position}`);
